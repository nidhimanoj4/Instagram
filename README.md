## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
Adding the comments tableView within the DetailedViewController was quite difficult and took a while. 
Also this project was one of the most complex with respect to the number of segues between pages
so clarifying and naming those (especially in places where there are multiple paths to take) was important and new. 
Adding a tabBarController was new and really interesting to implement in the App Delegate.
